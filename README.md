He has been working full time, steadily, since the age of 16. He recently left a job at jacobs engineering group where he worked for about 5 years. He started working at becton dickinson a few weeks ago. Referral to SMH was precipitated by pt seeing his PCP, Dr. Ford, for a physical and sharing concerns re: depression. He was having suicidal thoughts the week of 8/22/83 and noticed that his depression and anxiety symptoms were starting to interfere with work. Per Dr. Ford's recommendation, he contacted PAL for assistance. When screened for substance use, pt was referred to SMH for an intake. Pt was scheduled to be seen last week due to urgency of his depression and SI, but missed the intake appointment due to getting extremely intoxicated the night before. Pt presents today seeking individual therapy and psychiatry services to address longstanding depression.
PET Scan (DPSH 5/04/74): 1) Marked hypometabolism involving the bilateral caudate nuclei. This is a non-specific finding, although this raises the question of a multisystem atrophy, specifically MSA-P (striatonigral degeneration), 2) Cortical hypometabolism involving the right inferior frontal gyrus. This is a non-specific finding of uncertain significance, and is not definitively related to a neurodegenerative process, although pathology in this region is not excluded
